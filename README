ProspectLookup README

DEPENDENCIES: 
- googlesearch (DL @ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google)
	-> Used to search for each player and return first google result
	-> Worked well bc NBADraftnet and BasketballReference have good SEO
- dateutil (DL @ http://labix.org/python-dateutil#head-2f49784d6b27bae60cde1cff6a535663cf87497b)
	-> Used to convert a player's birthday from NBADraftnet to an age

CURRENT FEATURES:
- Added googlesearch functionality to return the college basketball reference page of given player
- Prints out his name, height, weight, number, age, and class
- Yearly averages and shooting percentages now included

TO DO:
- Add full HoopMath functionality
	- Currently have to match team data from BKRef -> HoopMath
- Keep player stats in dictionaries?
- Print in command prompt in tables with borders to allow for easy reading
- Add front end (React?) and host on personal site

AFTERWARDS:
- Maybe ask the user what kind of stats they are interested in? Per possession data over advanced? 
- Maybe ask the user what year they want the data from? FR, SO, JR, SR?
